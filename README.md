# Physics-Informed Neural Network Framework for Frozen Ground Modeling

This repository contains the implementation of the heat-conduction-informed neural network (HCINN) framework for frozen ground modeling and the reproducibility materials for the associated study.

The project is organized into two main components:

1. **Reproduction of study cases** (site-specific experiments)
2. **Training framework** (core model architecture and training pipeline)

This top-level README describes the overall structure of the repository. Each subfolder contains (or will contain) its own dedicated README for detailed explanations.


## 📦 `requirements.txt`

Lists all required Python dependencies to run the project.

To install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
